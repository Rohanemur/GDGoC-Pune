# GDGoC Pune

## AI/ML Workshop at MIT WPU - April 20, 2025

Today, we had an incredible AI/ML workshop organized by Google Developer Group of Cloud (GDGoC) at MIT World Peace University, Pune. The session was packed with enthusiastic students and developers eager to dive into the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### Workshop Highlights

The workshop focused on practical applications of AI/ML technologies, providing hands-on experience to participants. Here's what we covered:

- Introduction to fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Overview of Google Cloud's AI/ML offerings
- Hands-on lab sessions with real-world examples
- Building and deploying ML models

### MCP Server Project

One of the key achievements of today's workshop was the creation of an MCP (Master Control Program) server. Participants learned how to:

1. Set up the server environment
2. Configure the necessary dependencies
3. Implement basic AI functionalities
4. Deploy the server for real-time processing

The MCP server project demonstrated how AI services can be integrated into backend systems, allowing participants to see ML models in action.

### What's Next?

This workshop is just the beginning of our AI/ML journey with GDGoC Pune. Stay tuned for future events where we'll explore more advanced topics and build upon what we learned today.

Connect with us on social media and join our community to continue the learning experience!
